# PDBX

`pdbx` is a current rewrite of an internal PDBx/mmCIF toolkit for use with other lab projects. The new tools seek to be compatible with current local data and usable with the V4.0 and V5.0 editions of PDBx/mmCIF [with official specification changes provided by wwPDB](https://mmcif.wwpdb.org/). Additionally, related structure pipelines in the wild may not produce PDB files that strictly adhere to any specific version, so it is necessary to consider flexibility in the format specification.
